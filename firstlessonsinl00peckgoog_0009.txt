separately arranged, since it is desirable that while the pupil i
learning the different declensions and conjugatione, they should b
presented to his view in the same connection, and thus associated lt
' his memory.

An important part oi the plan has been, to annex to the Exe
· cises on each new lesson, Promiscuous Exerciscs, requiring ἰι
repeated application of what the pupil has previously studied ; s·
that while he advances step by step, ho shall not forget what he r.
once learned. Instead also os many examplcs of the same kin·
being arranged together, so that after one is understood no effert '
required tolcam the rest, ‘they have been carefully intermingled, :1
that the pupil will need to exorciso his own judgment in applyin
what he has learned, particularly the Rulos of Syntax.

These modificatione os the original plan of the Exercises ι
introduced after a thorongh practical test of their value made b
Whinnan Pack,A. M„ of Fannium, an experienced and s. “
instructor, who is entitled to the creditos such changes, and also o
the selection of the Fixamples not found in the former editions o
this work. The Exercises, with few exceptione, are taken fro..
good Latin writers, many of them from Nepos and Caesar, in orde
that pupils may become accustomed te a classica] style.

In the arrangement of the Parts of Speech, the Verb was iirs
introduced, as being indispensable to the formation os a comple
sentence, and then the other parts, in such order that sentence
could be conveniently selected for each without introducing tho
not yet learned.

Frequent reviews os what the pupil has learned will ba found o
great benefit; and the reacher will exercise his discretion in leavin
to a second or third reading certain portions of the book, such ι
the Rules for the Gender and oi the oblique cases ot' the third d.
elension‚ the Remarks under the Rules of Syntax, &a

Itis believed that the student who masters the contents of th'
book will be qualified to enter upon the study oi the Latin Reade
Caesar, or Nepos, with pleasure and profit.
