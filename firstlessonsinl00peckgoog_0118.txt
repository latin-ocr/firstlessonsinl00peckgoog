Ren. 6. —Adjectives and adjective pronouns, instead of agree·
ing with their nouas, are sometimes put in the neuter gendes, with .
a partitive signification, and their nonas in the genitiv03 as, mul- ¹
tam ternporis, for risaltnm tempas, much time.

Ren. 7. - 'l'he first part, last part, middle part, ete, of any place
or time are generally expressed in Latin hythe adjectivae primas,
nimius, ultianus, extremus, intimus, ipsimae, emes, autiernus, capriatae,

reliquus, and celet·a; as, Media rwx, he middle of the night. Semina
ardor, 'i'he top of a tree.

RELATIVES.

Rsn. 8. -Relatives agree with their antecedente in gender, num·
ber, and person ; but their case de nds on the construction of the
clause to which they belong3 ss, uer qui lepti, The boy who reads.
Aedt'fict'nm qrtod destruxit, 'Phe house which he built. Litcrae· quas
dedi, The letter which I gave.

( l ‚l Sometimes the antecedent is a proposition, and then the rela-
tive is commonly neuter. ’

(2.) A relative or demonstrative pronoun referring to a collective
noun is often put in the plural, taking the gender of the individuale
which the nona denotes.

(3.) etat, at the beginning of a sentence, is often translated like a
demonstrative3 as, Quae qzcum ita sint, Since these (things) are so.

POSSESSIVES.

Rsn. 9.-The possessive pronouns are often omitted, especially
when used as reflexives ; as, Quo revertar? in patriam? sc. meem ς
Whither shall I return? to (my) country?
