ARRANGEMENT.

In a Latin sentence, after connectebas, are placed,
first, the subject and its modifiers3 then the oblique
ceses, and other words which depcnd upon or modify
the verb ; and last of all, the verb.
l(lonnectives generally stand at the beginning of a
cause.

Oblique cases precede the words upon which they
depend, but they follow prepositions.

Infinitives precede the verbs on which they depend.

Relatives are commonly placed after their antece-
dents, and as near to them as possible.

The emphatic word is placed before the word or
words connected with it.

(they, etc.) fought 3 or, like popno poyrroto est, the ettle was fought.

“Sometimes the English subject of an impersonal
verb is, in Latin, an oblique case of a noun or pronomr
following the verb; as,

Miseret me toi, 1 pity you. Faveror tibi, Thou 'art favored.
